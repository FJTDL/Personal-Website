        Firstly, I found the original theory of using Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
        to be a very interesting idea, and that it did work as intended, allowing us to investigate
        the origins of the mice populations.
        <br>
        <br>
        However, when it comes to trying to differentiate between groups, LDA is a more standard technique.
        LDA has very stringent requirements that are rarely met, and QDA while less stringent, it also
        still has requirements in order to work properly. Although I could have checked if the requirements were met,
        I chose to use a non-parametric method instead, skipping over these requirements, and drawing results from
        a PLS-DA model.
        <br>
        <br>
        Additionally, since we are considering genetic data, it would make sense to try a
        tree model, akin to phylogenetic trees. This is easily done using the base R <b class="bg-blue-100 text-blue-700 px-1 rounded">dist()</b>
        and <b class="bg-blue-100 text-blue-700 px-1 rounded">hclust()</b> functions, but the problem was that the distances programmed for the base
        methods do not include Hamming distance, which would be the preferred measure in this problem.
        <br>
        <br>
        In this web-report, you will find explanations to my methods and analyses, as well as my conclusions.
        However, this will, in all likelihood, end up being a shortened version without much
        of the statistical depth I would usually include in a report. Why? Because it makes this page horribly long,
        and you really don't need it.

          <p class="text-gray-700">When we plot all of the populations, we can see a rather clear overlap of the groups, most significantly
            with the mainland group. There isn't much more we can learn from this plot right now so, let's remove the mainland!

          <p class="text-gray-700">
            By removing the mainland, we can now more clearly see some separation between the groups. For example, it currently appears
            that the Tonga15 population is very distinct from the Tonga07, while the Fisherman island population is almost a complete subset
            of the Adele07 population.

          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Here, we can see that the mainland population and the Adele15 are covering almost the exact same space, while the
            Fisherman population appears to overlap significantly with all other populations.

          <p class="text-gray-700">We can see from this plot that the Adele populations both overlap considerably
            with the Mainland, as well as each other. However, the direction that the two Adele populations are facing is different,
            suggesting that they are more similar to the Mainland than to each other.

          <p class="text-gray-700">We can quite clearly see that the Adele15 population is far more varied, and that it doesn't overlap
            as much with the Adele07 population as much as the previous plots might have suggested. This indicates that the two populations
            are not that closely related.

    <p>It is worth nothing that in all of these analyses, the PLS-DA method captures very low levels of variation. Even when the method is providing a high
      level of separation visually, it is important to remember that these plots do not even account for 25% of the total variation seen in the data.
      <br>
      <br>
      Overall, these plots tell us that there is fairly strong evidence to suspect that all populations are descended from the mainland in some way,
      that the Adele 2015 and Tonga 2015 populations are likely to be recent invaders from the mainland rather than survivors, and that Fisherman island 2007 population was likely seeded
      by Adele island rats sometime prior to the 2007 eradication event.
    </p>

    <p>Ideally, what we want to do now is find a way to compare how similar the rats are, and use this to construct a clustering solution, similar to phylogenetic trees.
      Given we are working with genetic data, this is a logical progression, and using the <b class="bg-blue-100 text-blue-700 px-1 rounded">dist()</b> and 
      <b class="bg-blue-100 text-blue-700 px-1 rounded">hclust()</b> functions, this should be a fairly simple process.
      <br>
      <br>
      However, one important detail is that the variables themselves are numbers, but these numbers are <i>labels</i>, not actual numeric values. This means that using
      a distnace such as Manhattan or Euclidean, would give a false idea of their similarity. A binary method would be better,
      but the base R binary distance checks if two observations are exactly the same, when we want to check this on a column-wise basis. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Thankfully, there is a well known distance we can easily implement to fix this, called the <b>Hamming Distance</b>, which we can implement easily with the function
      below.

    </pre>
    <p>This does, however, mean that we also need to install and load the <b class="bg-blue-100 text-blue-700 px-1 rounded">Proxy</b>
    package, so be aware of this if you attempt to recreate my code.
    <br>
    Additionally, note that the red clusters are somewhat arbitrary, and have mostly been used for illustrative purposes
    rather than forming proper clusters.

          <p class="text-gray-700">The full cluster solution shows a distinct branch of Fisherman island that are most closely related
            to a branch of mostly Adele07 mice, both of which are far removed from the other branches. We also observe a clear cluster of Tonga07
            mice, also rather distinct of other groups, while the Mainland and 2015 populations all appear to cluster together in
            roughly the same branches.

            and Fisherman populations form distinct clusters, and are most closely related to each other, and reasonably removed from the Mainland
            and Adele15 populations, which seem to cluster with each other. Adele15 forms several smaller clades within the larger cluster
            instead of clustering together in large groups as the other populations tend to do.

          <p class="text-gray-700">When considering just the Adele and Mainland populations, we see very clearly that the Adele07 population forms

          <p class="text-gray-700">In regards to Tonga, we once again we observe a 2007 population as being highly distinctive, while the 2015 "mixes" with the mainland.
            However, we observe much less scattering of the 2015 Tonga population compared to Adele, and in particular observe a distinctive clade emerge
            within one of the clusters. This suggests that the Tonga population may be old and thus more established, or that migration to the island is less common
            than it seems to be with Adele.

  <p>One advantage to this distance-based method is that we can compare the distances between two groups for statistical significance,
  and draw a more robust conclusion about the origin of the mice. However, many of the graphical methods proved viable in finding the 
  likely conclusions, so we do not need to apply many of these. In fact, we shall only apply one, to try to answer the question of if
  the Fisherman island population really is a "spin-off" of the Adele07 population, or if it came from the mainland.</p>

  <p>
    <i>Many of the conclusions drawn have been listed in prior sections, so consider this a summary.</i>
    <br>
    We can be quite confident that the 2007 eradication events were successful, and that the 2015 populations were seeded from the mainland.
    At the same time, we can also be quite confident that the Fisherman island 2007 population was seeded by the Adele 2007 population.
    This means that while the eradication method works, as long as there are mice on the mainland, they will get on the offshore islands as
    well, and may spread to other islands they may not have swum to from the mainland due to distance issues, using the immediate offshore islands
    as "staging grounds". There also appears to possibly be something about Tonga island that discourages a constant flow of mice to the island,
    although this could simply be due to chance.
